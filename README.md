# Realtime Environment Monitoring System

## Overview
This project monitors environmental parameters in real-time using ESP32, Arduino, and Edge AI models. Data is sent to the ThingSpeak cloud, and motors are controlled based on collected data.

## Components
- **ESP32**: Reads sensors and performs AI-based predictions.
- **Arduino**: Controls motor based on data.
- **ThingSpeak Cloud**: Stores and visualizes real-time data.
- **Edge AI**: Predicts environmental conditions using TensorFlow Lite.

## Instructions
1. Configure the ThingSpeak account.
2. Upload the ESP32 and Arduino codes.
3. Deploy the TFLite model for edge predictions.
